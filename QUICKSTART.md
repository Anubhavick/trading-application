## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

This project showcases all major OOP principles:

1. **Encapsulation**: Private data members with public interfaces
2. **Inheritance**: User â†’ Admin/Trader, Order â†’ BuyOrder/SellOrder
3. **Polymorphism**: Virtual functions for different user/order/strategy behaviors
4. **Abstraction**: Abstract base classes (User, Order, TradingStrategy)
5. **Composition**: Trader has-a Portfolio, Portfolio has-a Positions
